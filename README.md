# Form Validator

__Skill Level:__ Intermediate  
__Time Limit:__ 20-30 minutes

This challenge may take you more or less than the allotted time depending on your familiarity with JQuery selectors, javascript & the DOM.

In most apps, validation takes places both on the client & server if we're not including data type checks, foreign key constraints or other forms of validation that happen in our database. 

__Question:__ Why do we do client-side validation?

## Instructions
You have been given a simple login form in `index.html`. Your goal is to create a custom form validation script `validator.coffee` that prevents submission of the form and displays the correct error message if our user has entered invalid data. 

 - Do not edit the `index.html` or `style.css` files  
 - A valid email address (this could be tricky)
 - Password should be at least 8 characters long
 - Password should contain at least one capital letter
 - Password should contain at least one number (0-9)

## Extra Credit
If you're feeling especially daring, complete this challenge in coffeescript. Be sure to include your compiled javascript & original coffee files in your feature branch!

__Question:__ If you have an interest in professional Rails development, why is it probably a good idea to do this drill in Coffee instead of Javascript :)?
